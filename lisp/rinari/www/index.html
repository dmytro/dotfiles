    <p>Well, ok it kind of is. Rinari is a set of Emacs Lisp modes that is aimed towards making Emacs into a top-notch
      Ruby and Rails development environment.
    </p>

    <p>Right now it's mostly in the planning and early hacking
      stage. We're gathering ideas and have some initial code, but
      it's not quite ready for mass consumtion. There is the beginning
      of <a href='http://technomancy.us/article/emacsrails'>a
      tutorial</a> aimed towards explaining how it works from a high
      level. If you want to help or you've got ideas about
      functionality you wish Emacs had, please contact the developers
      via Rubyforge; or #ruby-lang on freenode. We are always open to new ideas.</p>
